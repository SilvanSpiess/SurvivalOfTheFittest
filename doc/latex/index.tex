\item \#\+Heading intro\+\_\+sec Introduction
\item This project is a C++ simulator that models the interaction of different life forms in a fictional world. The world contains instances of an abstract class Living,
\item which serves as the base class for all creatures and nature elements within this world. The following living things exist in this fictional world\+:
\item $\ast$ List item 1 {\bfseries{Empty}}
\item $\ast$ List item 2 {\bfseries{Grass}}
\item $\ast$ List item 3 {\bfseries{Rabbits}}
\item $\ast$ List item 4 {\bfseries{Foxes}}
\item Every form of life multiplies according to certain biological patterns. The individual life forms are either predator or prey to another life form. However, there are
\item extensions possible which make the simulation more realistic. One such extension which applies to foxes and rabbits are diseases, which break out at random. There are
\item other creatures possible besides the species foxes and rabbits, such as owls and mice.
\item The visualization heavily depends on your personal preferences. It will be a command-\/line interface (CLI) visualization. However, additional control mechanisms can be
\item implemented. Furthermore, the population statistics as well as the simulation properties should be visible.

\item Run CMake to generate the build files\+: {\itshape cmake ..}
\item 
\item Build the application\+: {\itshape make}
\item 
\item \# usage\+\_\+sec Usage
\item 
\item Run the application\+: $\ast$./world-\/of-\/fittest-\/simulation$\ast$
\item 
\item Follow the CLI prompts to configure the simulation.
\item 
\item View the simulation statistics and properties at the end of the simulation.
